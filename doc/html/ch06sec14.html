>     The SAVE PIC button on the control panel can be used to save the image in
the 3-D or sounding window to a file.  If you are in 'Sounding' mode the
sounding window will be saved, any other mode will save the 3-D window
(including all displays if multiple displays exist).  When you click on SAVE PIC
a pop-up window appears in which you can select the file format and filename.
The choices of file formats depends on the computer you're using or whether or
not you have the 'convert' program installed.  The formats supported by Vis5D
are:</P

>     It is recomended that the 'convert' program be downloaded.  This ensures
more save file formats and in some cases produces higher quality save pictures.
ImageMagick's 'convert' program can be downloaded at:
   ftp://ftp.wizards.dupont.com/pub/Imagemagick
and the www page is
   http://www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/ImageMagick.html
Once the 'convert' binary has been downloaded or compiled it has to be placed in
a directory 'util' where vis5d is being run.  For example if you are running
vis5d from '/usr/home/jane' then the convert program must be placed in
'/usr/home/jane/util'.</P
><P
>     Configurations of Vis5D  using OpenGL directly write XWD files.  The
following methods are used if no 'convert' program is present.  To make an RGB
file the fromxwd program is used.  Unfortunately, the fromxwd program shipped by
SGI has a bug which causes it to fail.  Since source code for fromxwd is shipped
with IRIX we include a patched version which works correctly.  To make a gif
file requires both fromxwd and togif (only available on SGI systems).  To make a
grayscale PostScript file requires the xpr utility (standard with X11).  To make
a color PostScript file the tops program is needed (only available on SGI
systems).</P
><P
>     If you don't have any of the utilities mentioned above you should try using 
<A

>
to convert your image files.</P
><P
>     To print a Vis5D image, position the mouse pointer over the 3-D window and
press the 
<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>P</B
> key.  If you are in 'Sounding' mode the sounding window will be
printed, any other mode and the 3-D window will be printed.  You'll be asked to
verify your action.  Vis5D uses lpr to send a PostScript image file to the
default printer or the printer specified by the PRINTER environment variable.
To generate the PostScript file Vis5D uses the utilities described above.  If
you have problems printing you should try to first save your image as a
PostScript file then try to print it manually using lpr or lp.  Another option
is to save your image as an XWD file then use xpr (a standard X11 utility) to
convert it to PostScript and print it.</P
><P
>     To learn more about the xwud, xpr, fromxwd, tops and togif program read the
man pages.  Many of these programs have options which you may find useful.</P
