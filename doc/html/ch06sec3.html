                After you've setup a variety of isosurfaces, slice, 
                wind trajectories and colors it is useful to be able 
                to save them and restore them the next time the data
                set is visualized.  You'll be prompted for a filename.  
                The file format, as of Vis5D 4.2 is a Tcl script.
                See <A
HREF="ch06sec16.html"
>section 6.16</A
> for
                more information.  Using the right mouse button when 
                clicking on this button will allow the current vis5d 
                data set to be saved to a file in the v5d format.

>[ANIM-REC] </TD

>This button works just like ANIMATE but allows fast
               animations on system with slow 3-D rendering.  After each time
               step is rendered the image is saved in memory.  When the
               animation loop repeats the images are quickly copied from memory
               to the 3-D window resulting in a faster animation. </TD

>REVERSE </TD
><TD
>Normally, the 3-D box and clock are drawn in white on a black
               background.  This option reverses that and draws a black box and
               clock on a white background.  This is useful for making paper
               print outs. </TD

>SAVE PIC </TD
><TD
>Used to save the image in the 3-D or sounding window to a file.
               When the 'Sounding' mode is chosen from the radio widgets the
               sounding window  will be saved.  If any other mode such as
               'Normal' or 'Slice' is chosen the 3-D window (including all
               displays if multiple displays exist) will be saved.  Depending on
               what system you're using a number of different picture file
               formats are supported.  On SGI systems be sure you have the
               'tops', 'frombin', and 'togif' program installed from your IRIX
               CD-ROM.  When using OpenGL on SGIs the 'fromxwd' program is also
               needed.  Unfortunately there is a bug in this program which often
               causes it to fail.  Included with vis5d however is a patched
               version of fromxwd.  An alternate way of insuring more save
               formats is to download ImageMagick's 'convert' program. See
